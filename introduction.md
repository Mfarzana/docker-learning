## Docker 
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. This is often described as containerization. 

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines

Virtual machines and containers differ in several ways, but the primary difference is that **containers** provide a way to **virtualize an OS so that multiple workloads can run on a single OS** instance. With **VMs**, the hardware is being virtualized to **run multiple OS instances**. Containersâ€™ speed, agility, and portability make them yet another tool to help streamline software development.
