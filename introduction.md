# Docker 
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. This is often described as containerization. Putting applications into containers leads to several advantages:

-   Docker containers are always portable. This means that you can build containers locally and deploy containers to any docker environment (other computers, servers, cloud, etc â€¦)
-   Containers are lightweight because containers are sharing the host kernel (the host operating system) but can also handle the most complex applications
-   Containers are stackable, services can be stacked vertically and on-the-fly.
