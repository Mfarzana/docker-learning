## NIC Card
A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a computer hardware component that allows a **computer to connect to a network**. NICs may be used for both wired and wireless connections.

**Linux OS has two-part**

 - **User Space**:User(Processes/Application/Services) need to do something and for that a typical interface is shell
 - **Kernel Space or Name Space**: Kernel is the only component that has direct access to hardware.
