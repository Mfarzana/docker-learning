## NIC Card
A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a computer hardware component that allows a **computer to connect to a network**. NICs may be used for both wired and wireless connections.
## Linux 
**Linux OS has two-part**

 - **User Space**:**User**(Processes/**Application**/Services) need to do something and for that a typical interface is shell
 - **Kernel Space or Name Space**: Kernel is the only component that has direct access to hardware.

> User Space ----> Kernel Space
                     Signals
                     System Calls 
If **User need** to **interact** with Kernel there is a limited option,which is provided by kernel and strictly defined by the kernel what user can do
