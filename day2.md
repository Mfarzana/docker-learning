## Basic Concept of Docker Networking 
 ### NIC Card
A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a computer hardware component that allows a **computer to connect to a network**. NICs may be used for both wired and wireless connections.

### Routing table
**The place where routing information is stored is called a routing table.**  **Routing table contains** routing entries, that is list of **destinations** (often called: list of network prefixes or routes).
>  **Destination IP** field of packet is checked against **information stored in router**
>  
### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
 **ARP** dynamically **translates** Internet addresses (**IP addresses**/logical addresses) **into** the unique hardware addresses(**MAC addresses**/Physical addresses)on local area networks.
 
## Linux Kernel Concept 
**Linux OS has two-part**

 - **User Space**:**User**(Processes/**Application**/Services) need to do something and for that a typical interface is shell
 - **Kernel Space or Name Space**: Kernel is the only component that has direct access to hardware.
 
All processes make system calls:

 **Processes running** under the **user space** have access only to a limited part of memory, whereas the kernel has access to all of the memory. **Processes running in user space also don't have access to the kernel space.** **User space processes** can only **access** a small part of the **kernel** via an **interface** exposed by the kernel - **the system calls.**  If a process performs a system call, a software interrupt is sent to the kernel, which then dispatches the appropriate interrupt handler and continues its work after the handler has finished.
                      
### System Calls
-  Essential part of Linux Operating System
- Processes cannot access the kernel directly
- **System calls are used as an interface for processes to the kernel**. glibc
- provides a library interface to use system calls from programs
- Common task like opening,listing,reading and writing to files all involves system calls
- The fork() and exec() system calls determine how a process start
- **fork()**: the **kernel** **creates** an almost identical **copy of the current process and replaces that**
- exec(): the kernel starts a program,which replaces the current process
There is one more thing involved in this whole process called libraries which is just an additional code used by either shell or process to add more functionalities.For eg: the most important one is glibc which provides functions and system calls
