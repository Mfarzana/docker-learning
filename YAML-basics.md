## YAML basics
### YAML
YAML is a human friendly **data serialization** standard for all programming languages. 
```
Serialization translate objects to another format, in case you want to store or share data.
Typical text-based serialization formats are CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, TOML, etc. Binary-based formats are protobuf and Avro.
```
### Common use cases such as:
* Configuration files
* Log files
* Inter-process messaging
* Cross-language data sharing
* Object persistence
* Complex data structures

### Basic rules
* YAML is case sensitive & .yaml as the extension.
* YAML does not allow the use of tabs while creating YAML files; spaces are allowed instead.

### Relationship to JSON and XML
