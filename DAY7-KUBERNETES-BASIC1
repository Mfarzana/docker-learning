## Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do?.
**Containers** are a good way to **bundle and run your applications**. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. **For example**, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?

That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.
