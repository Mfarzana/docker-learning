## Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do?.
**Containers** are a good way to **bundle and run your applications**. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. **For example**, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?

That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more. 

## Kubernetes Components
- When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.
- A Kubernetes **cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes,** that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
- The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. **The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster**. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

This document outlines the various components you need to have a complete and working Kubernetes cluster.

Here's the diagram of a Kubernetes cluster with all the components tied together.
