## Goals
- Create Dockerfile 
- Build a Docker image from Dockerfile
- Run image
- Pushing and Pulling to and from Docker Hub

## Dockerfile
Dockerfile has two parts instruction and arguments. Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 
- **FROM java:8-jdk-alpine**â€” very Dockerfile typically starts with a FROM line.
-  our image will be based on another image that is available on public repository (Docker Hub) that contains all **necessary dependencies** that we would need to run any **Java application**.


This is the starting point for your Dockerfile. E This FROM command receives as argument a basic existent docker image that we will use to build our layers on top of. The base image passed as argument is openjdk:8-jdk-alpine. This image contains a jdk version 8 already installed. The alpine version means that the image makes use of the alpine distribution, which is significantly smaller than any other Linux distribution.

## Push docker image to Docker Hub Registry
- **Spring Boot Demo Project Structure:**
- ![enter image description here](https://github.com/Mfarzana/docker-learning/blob/master/images/demo-project-structure.jpg)
#### Step 1: Go to project directory and create a docker file 
 For example, my project was in desktop demo folder
  ```
  C:\Users\Farzana>cd Desktop\demo
  ```
  **My  Dockerfile** 
	
	FROM java:8-jdk-alpine
	COPY ./target/demo.war /usr/app/
	WORKDIR /usr/app
	EXPOSE 8080
	ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "demo.war"]
	
 **NB:  . (dot) mean current directory** 
####  Step 2: Create docker image from Dockerfile
 ```
 C:\Users\Farzana\Desktop\demo>docker build -t mfarzana/demo-spring:0.0.1 . 
 ```

#### Step 3: Push image to Docker Hub
```
C:\Users\Farzana\Desktop\demo>docker login 
#Put username and password and use this command
C:\Users\Farzana\Desktop\demo>docker push mfarzana/demo-spring:0.0.1
 ```
